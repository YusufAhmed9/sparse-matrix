# Sparse Matrix

A **sparse matrix** is a matrix where most of the elements are zero. It's a way to efficiently store and manipulate matrices, particularly large ones, where a significant portion of the data is made up of zeros.
## Why Use Sparse Matrices?

- **Memory Efficiency**: Only non-zero elements are stored, saving space.
- **Faster Computations**: Algorithms can skip zero values, improving performance.
- **Scalability**: Useful for large datasets like graphs, machine learning models, and scientific computations.

## Common Storage Formats

- **COO (Coordinate List)**: Stores row, column, and value of non-zero elements.
- **CSR (Compressed Sparse Row)**: Efficient for row slicing and matrix-vector products.
- **CSC (Compressed Sparse Column)**: Efficient for column slicing and solving linear systems.

## Applications

- Graphs (adjacency matrices)
- Recommendation systems
- Natural language processing (bag-of-words models)
- Image compression



## Implementation Provided Content

This project includes a basic implementation of sparse matrix operations:

-  **Setting and getting values**
-  **Adding two matrices (with the same size)**
